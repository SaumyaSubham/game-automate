# GameAutomate Control for Hill Climb Racing üïπÔ∏è

# Overview:

Welcome to my GameAutomate repository! Here, I'm excited to present my innovation in the realm of gaming automation - a Python-based solution that lets you control the popular game "Hill Climb Racing" using hand gestures. It makes the game more reliable and more innovative to play.

# Project Description:

In this project, I've developed an automation system that enables players to control the in-game car's movements using their hand gestures. The system captures real-time video input from a webcam, processes it to detect hand gestures, and then translates these gestures into controls for the game. No need for a keyboard or mouse - just use your hand and navigate the game!

# Key Features:

- Gesture Recognition: The heart of the project lies in its ability to accurately recognize hand gestures in real time. By utilizing OpenCv and Mediapipe libraries of Python, I've made the system to detect specific hand movements corresponding to game controls.

- Real-time Interaction: Players can now accelerate, and brake their in-game car by simply moving their hands in predefined ways. This real-time interaction enhances the gaming experience and provides a unique and immersive way to play.

- Adaptability: The system is designed to work with different lighting conditions and various hand sizes, making it accessible and adaptable for a wide range of users.

Technologies Used:

- Python

- OpenCV (for computer vision)

- Gesture Recognition Algorithms (custom-developed)

- Hill Climb Racing (game)

- Webcam (for hand tracking)

How to Use:

[Include instructions here on how to setup and use this project on the game.]

Conclusion
"Game Automate Control Hill Climb Racing" is a demonstration of how technology can transform the way we interact with games. By merging computer vision and gaming, I've created a hands-on experience that blends my coding skills with a touch of excitement. I invite you to explore, contribute, and take this project to new heights!
